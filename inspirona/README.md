Hello! This is a random project on which I worked on my random times. This was made from the idea of super-duper basic knowledge in javascript. My quotes.js file contains a list object variable. The quotes and authors property are placed in respective values. If you want a quote to be included, just edit the js file.

I will work on this project till it reaches at least 1000 quotes.
